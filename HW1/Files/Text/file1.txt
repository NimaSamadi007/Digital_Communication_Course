Quantum mechanics allows the calculation of properties and behaviour of physical systems. It is typically applied to microscopic systems molecules atoms and sub atomic particles. It has been demonstrated to hold for complex molecules with thousands of atoms but its application to human beings raises philosophical problems such as Wigner friend and its application to the universe as a whole remains speculative. Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy. A fundamental feature of the theory is that it usually cannot predict with certainty what will happen but only give probabilities. Mathematically a probability is found by taking the square of the absolute value of a complex number known as a probability amplitude. This is known as the Born rule named after physicist Max Born. For example a quantum particle like an electron can be described by a wave function which associates to each point in space a probability amplitude. Applying the Born rule to these amplitudes gives a probability density function for the position that the electron will be found to have when an experiment is performed to measure it. This is the best the theory can do it cannot say for certain where the electron will be found. The Schrodinger equation relates the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to one moment of time to the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to another.
